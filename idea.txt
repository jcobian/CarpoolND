When someone request a ride
You go through each existing carpool and add the requested origin and destinatoin as waypoints to each existing carpool by adding the following:
if a carpool already exists from A to B and the request is from C to D then
the waypoint is: A to C to D to B

You then compare the times from the original carpool (A to B) to the new one w/ waypoints (ACDB) and if the time diff is below a certain threshold then bam! display it
