I chose to take this class because I have heard it is a very useful class to take. Also, I worked with some database software this summer, and I enjoyed using it. Since it was both useful and enjoyable, I thought it would be a good idea to take the class. From what I have heard, storing large amounts of data is a topic that often comes up in interviews for Notre Dame students. It would be nice to learn this topic in this class, to prepare for interviews and future jobs. I am excited to learn how a database and web page talk to each other. I don't know how to set up my own database from scratch, so I am also interested to see how that is done.
